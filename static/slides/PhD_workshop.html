Why Operational Research?
If you zoom in on the edge of human knowledge in the realm of data-driven decision-making, there’s something just out of reach: the ability to transform overwhelming complexity into clear, life-saving choices.

We turned to Operational Research and Management Science after understanding how crucial it is to translate raw data into meaningful actions. Whether during a disaster, in a fragile healthcare system, or managing a disrupted supply chain, or in transition to sustainability—the right decision can save lives. Every decision counts, and every misstep can cost dearly.

While the challenges may seem daunting, the solutions are within reach—if we make the right decisions based on solid analysis. Even a single inefficiency in delivering aid or managing resources is one too many. Operational Research gives us the tools to break through those challenges, providing the answers we need in critical moments.

From optimizing emergency response to ensuring that vital supplies reach those who need them most, Operational Research gives us the tools to solve humanity's toughest challenges. In these moments, we’re not just analyzing numbers—we’re making decisions that impact lives.


The only way to solve these kinds of problems is through scientific methods that optimize decisions.

And, the best way to drive innovation and smart decision-making is through cultivating talented researchers and professionals in the field.

The key to solving these life-threatening problems lies in scientific methods that optimize decision-making. And the best way to advance this field is by nurturing the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers, who will be ready when it matters most.

---
## Reproducibility

Someone (or your future self) should be able to reproduce your thesis without having to guess what software you had installed, what versions, which files do what, etc.

- Stay organized.
- One system for doing this using R or python or both is to write your thesis in
an Rmarkdown or Quarto file.
Track software versions

---
## Version control

- thesis_v1, thesis_v2, etc., is not adequate version control.
- You need to track changes over time, have a remote repository, and be able to roll back as required.
- Your repository should contain everything required to produce your thesis including computer code, references, writing.
- Your repository should have an obvious structure and be fully documented.
- .remember[Github] solves these problems
- Read “Happy git with R”: happygitwithr.com

---
## Version control with git

- .remember[RStudio] integrates with github, so version control built in.
- But github can be used with any text-based language including Python, LaTeX, R, Rmarkdown, Quarto,
markdown, etc.

- Git allows you to:
  - track changes
  - experiment in branches
  - undo

- Github provides:
  - backup and restore
  - synchronization

---
## Writing 
### Microsoft word

❌ Impossible to do proper version control

❌ Poor formatting of equations

❌ Impossible to make reproducible

❌ More difficult to automate cross-referencing, numbering

❌ Files more likely to be corrupted

❌ With One Drive , even worse

---
## Writing 
### Quarto

✅  Combines R, Python , plain text and LaTeX into one system, reference management

✅  One tool to do all , writing, analysis, version control, file sharing, etc

✅  Render files to pdf, word, html, and latex formats

✅  Reproducible research

✅  See quarto.org for help

## Critique

A critique is an evaluation of your work that highlights both strengths and areas for improvement. It helps .remember[identify gaps or weaknesses] you might have .remember[missed].

We must embrace critique, why?

--

- A willingness to learn and evolve,
- Encourages intellectual growth and skill development,
- Pushes you to think critically, 
- Improve your arguments,
- Strengthen your work, 
- Making you a better researcher and individual.

.pull-right[
### Paper
- critique is about your work
- Take time to read the feedback
- Break down the feedback into categories—e.g., structure, argument clarity, or methodological issues
- Acknowledge valid points, but stand your ground when necessary
- Stay patient and view each revision as an opportunity to strengthen your work.
- Stay professional and grateful
- Use critique for future papers
]

???
Listen Actively and Stay Open-Minded: During critiques, focus on understanding the feedback rather than reacting defensively. Listening with an open mind allows you to fully grasp constructive suggestions that can improve your work.

Engage with the Audience: If critiques arise during the Q&amp;A session, engage with the audience by acknowledging their points and offering thoughtful responses. Don’t rush to defend; instead, view questions as an opportunity to clarify or expand on your ideas.

Ask Clarifying Questions: If feedback isn’t clear or seems contradictory, ask polite, clarifying questions. This will not only help you better understand the critique but also show your willingness to engage and improve.

Separate Personal Feelings from Professional Feedback: Critiques are about the work, not you as a person. Avoid taking feedback personally. Instead, view it as an opportunity to improve the quality of your research or presentation.

Reflect and Prioritize: After receiving feedback, take time to reflect on the points made. Prioritize which critiques are most relevant to your work and make a plan to address them, while understanding that you don’t have to implement every suggestion.

---
## Ground rules for giving critiques

- .remember[Be Constructive]: Focus on providing helpful, actionable feedback rather than simply pointing out flaws
- .remember[Be specific and objective]: Clearly point out specific aspects of the presentation—whether content, delivery, or format, structure
- .remember[Start with positive feedback]: acknowledge what the presenter did well
- When providing feedback, frame your comments as suggestions for improvement rather than directives
    - "You might consider ...", "It could help to ..."
    - “There seems to be a significant issue with…” or “The methodology might need to be re-evaluated because…”
- .remember[Be Respectful and empathetic]: Critiquing someone’s presentation can be sensitive, so always maintain a respectful and empathetic tone


???

Here are five ground rules for giving critiques in presentations:

1. Be Constructive, Not Critical
Focus on providing helpful, actionable feedback rather than simply pointing out flaws. Frame your suggestions in a way that encourages improvement, such as offering alternative approaches or solutions to any issues you notice.

2. Be Specific and Objective
Avoid vague or overly general comments. Clearly point out specific aspects of the presentation—whether content, delivery, or visuals—that could be improved, and explain why. Keep the critique based on observable facts rather than subjective opinions.

3. Start with Positive Feedback
Acknowledge what the presenter did well before diving into areas for improvement. Starting with positive feedback sets a respectful tone and helps the presenter feel more receptive to the critique.

4. Offer Suggestions, Not Demands
When providing feedback, frame your comments as suggestions for improvement rather than directives. Phrasing feedback as “You might consider…” or “It could help to…” makes the presenter feel more in control of how they wish to apply the advice.

5. Be Respectful and Empathetic
Critiquing someone’s presentation can be sensitive, so always maintain a respectful and empathetic tone. Put yourself in the presenter’s shoes and be mindful of how your feedback might be received, aiming to support their growth rather than discourage them.

- Refer to guidelines for providing and receiving feedback
- Active listening
- Create a Culture of enquiry, not Judgment
- Practice empathy
- Encourage balanced feedback
- Assign roles during seminars, such as "feedback lead" or "question asker."
]

.pull-right[
1. .remember[Clarify]: Ask questions to ensure you fully understand the work or presentation before critiquing.
2. .remember[Value]: Start by stating the aspects of the work you find valuable or effective.
3. .remember[Concerns]: Gently express concerns, focusing on areas where the work could be improved.
4. .remember[Suggestions]: Offer specific suggestions for addressing the concerns and improving the work.
]

???


Introduce a feedback framework such as "Compliment-Suggest-Question" to guide members:

Compliment: Start by identifying something positive in the research or presentation.
Suggest: Offer one or more suggestions for improvement in a constructive manner.
Question: Ask questions to clarify understanding or explore areas that may need further explanation or development.

???
Prepare Questions or Topics: Prior to each meeting, collect questions via Slack, from group members. You could use Slack where members can submit their questions.

Categorize Topics: Separate technical and non-technical questions. This will help structure the discussion and ensure that the focus stays balanced. If needed, dedicate separate time blocks in the meeting to address each type.
Prioritize: If there are a lot of questions, prioritize based on urgency, relevance, or the number of people affected by the issue. This ensures the most pressing matters are addressed first.

Rotate Meeting Roles
Facilitator/Moderator: Assign a facilitator to lead each meeting. Rotate this role among members to give everyone a chance to lead and ensure that discussions remain focused and inclusive.
Note-Taker: Designate someone to take notes during the meeting, capturing key takeaways, action points, and answers to the questions discussed. These can be shared afterward to benefit those who couldn’t attend and serve as a record for future reference.

 Promote Inclusivity and Open Discussion
Encourage Participation: Ensure that everyone feels comfortable sharing their questions or providing answers. Promote an inclusive atmosphere where no question is seen as too simple or irrelevant.
Ask for Clarifications: If a question or answer is unclear, encourage others to ask for clarifications. This will help ensure that everyone fully understands the topic being discussed.
Be Respectful of Non-Technical Topics: Some members may want to discuss non-technical issues like work-life balance, career development, or soft skills. Dedicate time for these topics, as they are often just as important as technical discussions.

Example Structure for the Meetings:
Welcome and Quick Updates (5-10 minutes)
Announcements or updates on group activities or ongoing projects.
Technical Questions and Problem-Solving (20-30 minutes)
Group members discuss submitted technical questions.
Collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing.
Non-Technical Discussion (10-15 minutes)
Address non-technical topics, such as career advice, work culture, or productivity.
Action Points and Closing (5 minutes)
Summarize key takeaways, assign any follow-up tasks, and agree on the agenda for the next meeting.

## Mental health awareness

- Acknowledge the pressure and seek support
- Establish a healthy work-life balance
    - Setting clear work hours, taking regular breaks, and dedicating time to hobbies, social activities, and self-care
- Develop resilience and coping strategies
    - meditation, physical activity, or journaling, etc
- Normalize conversations about Mental Health

???
1. Acknowledge the Pressure and Seek Support
PhD students often face intense pressure to meet academic and research expectations. It's important to recognize when stress levels are becoming unmanageable. Seeking support from peers, supervisors, or mental health professionals can help. Many universities offer counseling services or peer support groups designed specifically for graduate students.

2. Establish a Healthy Work-Life Balance
The demands of a PhD can easily lead to burnout if boundaries between work and personal life are blurred. Setting clear work hours, taking regular breaks, and dedicating time to hobbies, social activities, and self-care can help maintain balance and prevent exhaustion.

3. Normalize Conversations About Mental Health
Openly discussing mental health can reduce stigma and encourage others to share their experiences. In your research group or academic community, promoting discussions on mental well-being and creating safe spaces for people to express their challenges can foster a supportive environment.

4. Develop Resilience and Coping Strategies
The PhD journey is full of ups and downs—rejections, criticism, and setbacks are part of the process. Building resilience through mindfulness, stress-management techniques, and staying connected to your broader purpose can help you navigate challenges. Identifying coping strategies that work for you, like meditation, physical activity, or journaling, is essential for long-term mental well-being.

5. Set Realistic Goals and Manage Expectations
The nature of research can sometimes lead to feelings of uncertainty or self-doubt. Setting small, realistic goals and celebrating incremental progress can boost motivation and reduce feelings of overwhelm. Regularly communicating with your supervisor about your progress and adjusting expectations when needed can prevent unnecessary stress and help keep things in perspective.

---
## Work-life balance

- Set boundaries and stick to a schedule
    - Create a consistent daily or weekly work schedule
    - Avoid emails or work-related messages outside of these hours
- Plan and prioritize tasks
  - focus on high-priority tasks and avoid overcommitting
  - Prioritize completing essential tasks within your set work hours
- Creates a mental distinction between work and relaxation spaces
    - Try to come to Doctoral Space at least 2-3 days a wekk
- Set aside time for hobbies and socializing
- Schedule time to completely unplug from digital devices, especially those that connect you to work (laptops, emails, messaging apps)
- Plan holidays in Advance - you can take up to 6 weeks off  (typically Xmas, Easter, July or August)

???
1. Set Boundaries and Stick to a Schedule
Create a consistent daily or weekly work schedule that includes clear start and stop times. Stick to these boundaries to ensure you have time for personal activities, hobbies, and relaxation.
Avoid checking emails or responding to work-related messages outside of these hours to create a mental separation between work and personal life.
2. Plan and Prioritize Tasks
Use time management tools, like the Pomodoro technique or a task prioritization matrix, to focus on high-priority tasks and avoid overcommitting. Break your workload into manageable chunks and create daily to-do lists.
Prioritize completing essential tasks within your set work hours to reduce the temptation to work late or on weekends.
3. Take Regular Breaks and Practice the 5-Minute Rule
Step away from your desk for short, regular breaks throughout the day. Even a 5-minute break every hour can improve focus and productivity while preventing burnout.
During busy periods, use the "5-minute rule" for self-care: If you're feeling overwhelmed, take just 5 minutes to do something for yourself (e.g., stretch, meditate, or listen to music).
4. Designate a Physical Workspace
If possible, create a dedicated workspace (even if it’s a small corner in your home) that you only use for work. This creates a mental distinction between work and relaxation spaces, helping you “leave work behind” when you step away.
Avoid working in places associated with rest, like your bed or couch, to maintain the mental separation between work and leisure.
5. Set Aside Personal Time for Hobbies and Socializing
Block out personal time on your calendar for activities that help you recharge, whether it's exercise, reading, creative hobbies, or socializing with friends and family.
Treat these personal time slots as non-negotiable appointments to ensure you make space for your own well-being and enjoyment.
6. Learn to Say No and Set Limits on Commitments
It’s important to recognize when you’re taking on too much. Be realistic about how much you can handle and feel comfortable saying “no” or negotiating deadlines when appropriate.
Setting limits on the number of extra projects, side tasks, or social obligations can protect your personal time and mental energy.
7. Unplug and Disconnect Regularly
Schedule time to completely unplug from digital devices, especially those that connect you to work (laptops, emails, messaging apps). This can be during weekends, evenings, or designated "off-screen" days.
Establish tech-free zones or hours where you focus on offline activities and disconnect from the demands of technology.
8. Practice Mindfulness and Stress Management
Incorporating mindfulness practices, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, into your daily routine can help reduce stress and improve focus.
Regularly checking in with yourself to assess stress levels and taking steps to manage them can prevent work-related stress from overwhelming your personal life.
9. Delegate or Share Responsibilities
Don’t hesitate to delegate tasks when appropriate, especially in group projects or collaborations. Sharing the workload reduces personal pressure and ensures that you don’t feel overwhelmed by too many tasks.
10. Plan Time Off in Advance
Make time for vacations or extended breaks by planning them in advance. Inform your supervisors and colleagues about your time off so you can fully disconnect without feeling guilty or anxious about your absence.
Even short getaways or staycations can help you reset and recharge mentally.
