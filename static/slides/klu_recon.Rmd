## Classical approaches to forecast vaccine needs

- Demographic methods (developed by WHO, one-size-fits-all model)
      - expected target population
      - coverage: is the expected coverage rate
      - doses/target: is the number of doses per target, as per the national vaccination schedule
      - wastage factor


.alert-note[.remember[**Forecasts are annual and at the national level**]]

---
## Limitations of current forecasting method


❌  Forecasts are yearly and at the national level(not useful to inform operational / tactical decisions.)

❌  Forecasts are  often produced based on unrealistic assumptions.

❌  Forecasts do not acknowledge uncertainty.

❌  Do not capture the information available at multiple hierarchical levels.

❌  Forecasts ignore the hierarchical nature of the problem, not coherent.

❌  Lead to conflicting decisions & lack of coordination.

## Forecast reconciliation
 
- This approach involves first generating independent base forecast for each series in the hierarchy (i.e. Base)

--

- As these base forecasts are independently generated they will not be “aggregate consistent” (i.e., they will not add up according to the hierarchical structure). They are .remember[not coherent].

--

- The reconciliation approaches combine the independent base forecasts and generates a set of revised forecasts that are as close as possible to the univariate forecasts but also aggregate consistently with the hierarchical structure.

--

- Unlike any other existing method, this approach uses all the information available within a hierarchy.


---
## Reconciled forecasts-notations

- Let $\large {b}_t$ be a vector of $\large n_b$ _bottom-level_ time series at time $\large t$, and let $\large {a}_t$ be a corresponding vector of $\large n_a = n-n_b$ aggregated time series, where $\large a_t = {A}{b}_t,$

--

- $\large A$ is the $\large n_a\times n_b$ "aggregation" matrix specifying how the bottom-level series ${b}_t$ are to be aggregated to form $\large {a}_t$. 

--

- The full vector of time series is given by $\large y_t = \begin{bmatrix}{a}_t \\{b}_t\end{bmatrix}.$

--

- This leads to the $\large n\times n_b$ "summing" or "structural" matrix given by
$\large S = \begin{bmatrix}{A} \\ {I}_{n_b}\end{bmatrix}$, such that $\large {y}_t = {S}{b}_t$.

- Similar approach can be used to create reconciled forecasts, $\large \tilde{{y}}_t = {SG}{\hat{y}}_t$.

##  Linear reconciliation methods, Bottom-up and others

Forecast reconciliation approaches combine and reconcile all the base forecasts in order to produce coherent forecasts. 

--

Linear reconciliation methods (Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman 2019) can be written as

$$\large \tilde{{y}}_h = {S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h ={S}{G}\hat{{y}}_h = {M}\hat{{y}}_h,$$

where ${W}$ is an $n \times n$ positive definite matrix, and $\hat{{y}}_h$ contains the $h$-step forecasts of ${y}_{T+h}$ given data to time $T$. ${W}^{-1}$ is the variance-covariance matrix of h-step ahead errors. 

- W is the only unknown to get the reconciled forecast.

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ## Choosing W -->

<!-- - Different choices for ${W}$ lead to different solutions such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Minimum Trace (MinT).  -->
<!-- - We use the implementation of these methods in the `hts` package in R in the experiment. -->

<!-- .center[ -->
<!-- <img src="img/matrix_w.png" height="280px"> -->
<!-- ] -->

---
## Producing probabilistic forecasts

- We use bootstrapping to generate probabilistic forecasts:

    - Suppose that $(\hat{{y}}_h^{[1]},\dots,\hat{{y}}_h^{[B]})$ are a set of $B$ simulated sample paths, generated independently from the models used to produce the base forecasts. 
    - Then $({S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h^{[1]},\dots,{S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h^{[B]})$ provides a set of reconciled sample paths, from which percentiles can be calculated.

## Forecasting setup

- Forecast horizon: 12 months
- Point and probabilistic forecasts are generated and evaluated for the entire hierarchy
- Forecast evaluation

    - Time series cross-validation with re-estimation
    - Used 36 months as test set

---
## Forecasting models

- **Naive:** Assuming that the future days will be similar to past days. We use the empirical distribution of the past daily demand
- **Exponential Smoothing State Space model (ETS):** ETS models can combine trend, seasonality, and error components in a time series
- **Poisson Regression using tscount (TSGLM):** Poisson regression model that takes into account serial dependence and predictors
- **Ensemble method:** Finally, we use an ensemble method that combines the forecasts generated from the Naive, ETS, and TSGLM models to form a mixture distribution

## Conclusions
### Benefit of hierarchical forecasting

✅  Plans at any level are based on .remember[coherent forecasts] and therefore can be aligned. 

✅  Hierarchical forecasting framework can be used as a tool to .remember[improve coordination] between teams across the supply chain at the national, sub-national, regional and local levels.

✅  Result can be .remember[more accurate than the independent (base) forecasts].

✅  Hierarchical forecasting framework an be used to create coherent forecast, regardless of how base forecasts are created, even with judgmental forecasts.

## Next steps

- Developing an impact case study with JSI

- Developing hybrid methods that integrates current forecasting method in immunization programs

- Evaluate the implication of forecast accuracy on utilities such as cost, service level, coordination, etc by linking to replenishment policies.
