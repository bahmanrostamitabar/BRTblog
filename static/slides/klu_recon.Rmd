## Classical approaches to forecast vaccine needs

- Demographic methods (developed by WHO, one-size-fits-all model)
      - expected target population
      - coverage: is the expected coverage rate
      - doses/target: is the number of doses per target, as per the national vaccination schedule
      - wastage factor


.alert-note[.remember[**Forecasts are annual and at the national level**]]

---
## Limitations of current forecasting method


❌  Forecasts are yearly and at the national level(not useful to inform operational / tactical decisions.)

❌  Forecasts are  often produced based on unrealistic assumptions.

❌  Forecasts do not acknowledge uncertainty.

❌  Do not capture the information available at multiple hierarchical levels.

❌  Forecasts ignore the hierarchical nature of the problem, not coherent.

❌  Lead to conflicting decisions & lack of coordination.

## Conclusions
### Benefit of hierarchical forecasting

✅  Plans at any level are based on .remember[coherent forecasts] and therefore can be aligned. 

✅  Hierarchical forecasting framework can be used as a tool to .remember[improve coordination] between teams across the supply chain at the national, sub-national, regional and local levels.

✅  Result can be .remember[more accurate than the independent (base) forecasts].

✅  Hierarchical forecasting framework an be used to create coherent forecast, regardless of how base forecasts are created, even with judgmental forecasts.

---
## Next steps

- Collect data on potential useful predictors such as child population, conflicts, strike, weather conditions, etc

- Build new forecasting models incorporating strong driving factors of vaccine demand

- Evaluate the implication of forecast accuracy on utilities such as cost, service level, coordination, etc by linking to replenishment policies.

##  Linear reconciliation methods, Bottom-up and others

Forecast reconciliation approaches combine and reconcile all the base forecasts in order to produce coherent forecasts. 

--

Linear reconciliation methods (Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman 2019) can be written as

$$\large \tilde{{y}}_h = {S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h ={S}{G}\hat{{y}}_h = {M}\hat{{y}}_h,$$

where ${W}$ is an $n \times n$ positive definite matrix, and $\hat{{y}}_h$ contains the $h$-step forecasts of ${y}_{T+h}$ given data to time $T$. 

--

.small[
- Different choices for ${W}$ lead to different solutions such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Minimum Trace (MinT). 
- We use the implementation of these methods in the `hts` package in R in the experiment.
]

---
## Producing probabilistic forecasts

- We use bootstrapping to generate probabilistic forecasts:

    - Suppose that $(\hat{{y}}_h^{[1]},\dots,\hat{{y}}_h^{[B]})$ are a set of $B$ simulated sample paths, generated independently from the models used to produce the base forecasts. 
    - Then $({S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h^{[1]},\dots,{S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h^{[B]})$ provides a set of reconciled sample paths, from which percentiles can be calculated.

## Reconciled forecasts
 
- This approach involves first generating independent base forecast for each series in the hierarchy (i.e. Base)

--

- As these base forecasts are independently generated they will not be “aggregate consistent” (i.e., they will not add up according to the hierarchical structure). They are .remember[not coherent].

--

- The reconciliation approaches combine the independent base forecasts and generates a set of revised forecasts that are as close as possible to the univariate forecasts but also aggregate consistently with the hierarchical structure.

--

- Unlike any other existing method, this approach uses all the information available within a hierarchy.
