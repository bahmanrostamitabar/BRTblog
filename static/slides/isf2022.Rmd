## Literature limitations: relying on point forecast

❌ Studies are limited to only predicting future arrivals as a point forecast (a single number)

## Literature limitations

❌   most of studies do not consider the full extent of the multiple seasonality and changing profile over time

❌   Publications are not reproducible as underlying data and code are not available

❌   studies are limited in terms of the length of historical data used for training and forecast performance evaluation

❌   some studies in this area .remember[lack a rigorous experimental design], i.e. they do not use benchmark methods, report forecast accuracy or use cross-validation.


---
## Research Objetives

Based on this analysis and the literature review, we should consider developing probabilistic models that can take the following into account:

- Hour-of-day, day-of-week, and week-of-year seasonalities,
- Long-term trend (or a slowly changing level),
- Calendar events, such as holidays,
- Lags of calendar events to accommodate the potential changes in demand the next day after a
holiday,
- Other events, such as sporting fixtures,
- Temperature effects.

## Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS)

- Assuming our forecast distribution follows a given parametric distribution. 
- The forecast task would be to predict the future values of that distribution’s parameters. 

- We then can use Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). 

- These are the distributional regression models where the parameters are modelled as additive functions of explanatory variables. 

- This provides a powerful and flexible framework for probabilistic forecasting.

---
## Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS)

- $F_t(y_t)$ is a predictive cumulative probability distribution of $y_t$
- $F_t(y_t)$ is modelled via a parametric model, $F(y_t|\theta_t)$, where $\theta_t$ is an $m$-dimensional vector of parameters
- In the GAMLSS framework [1] the elements $j=1,...,m$ of $\theta_t$ are modelled as

\begin{equation}
    g_j(\theta_{j,t})=\mathbf{A}_{j,t} \beta_j + \sum_{i} f_{j,i}({x}^{S_{j,i}}_t), \;\;\; \text{for} \;\;\; j = 1, \dots, m,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    f_{j,i}(x^{S_{j,i}}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K_{j,i}} b^{ji}_k (x^{S_{j,i}}) \beta_k^{ji},
\end{equation}

---
## GAMLSS

We start with a Poisson distribution with an additive model for $\log \lambda_t$ of the form

\begin{equation}
  \log(\lambda_t) = \sum_{i=1}^7 \beta_i \delta(D_i(t)-i) + \sum_{j=1}^7 D_j(t) f_j(H(t)) + t f_\text{Y}(Y(t)) + f_\text{Temp}(Y(t),C_t) \quad .
\end{equation}

The functions $H(t)$, $D(t)$ and $Y(t)$ return the hour of the day (1-24), day of the week (1-7), and day of the year (1-366) at time $t$, respectively, and $C_t$ is the temperature at time $t$. This model is called Poisson-1 in discussions below.

- we consider an extension to the additive models to incorporate school and public holidays into $D$. These models are labelled Poisson-2

---
More flexible, two-parameter distributions: the truncated Normal distribution, with truncation at 0. 

\begin{equation}
F_t(y_t,\mu_t,\sigma_t) =  \frac{\Phi\left( \frac{y_t-\mu_t}{\sigma_t} \right) - \Phi\left( \frac{-y_t}{\sigma_t} \right)}{1 - \Phi\left( \frac{-y_t}{\sigma_t} \right)}
(\#eq:truncatedn)
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
	& \mu_t = \sum_{i=1}^{10} \beta_i D^{+}_i(t) + \sum_{j=1}^{10} D^{+}_j(t) f_j(H(t)) + t f_\text{Y}(Y(t)) + f_\text{Temp}(Y(t),C_t) \\
	& log(\sigma_t) = \sum_{i=1}^{10} D^{+}_i(t) f(H(t))
\end{align*}

## Conclusions

- Two approaches produced highly accurate, calibrated probabilistic forecasts:
      1. The first is ADAM-iESTX
      2. Labeled NOtr-2 
- The point prediction produced by ADAM-iESTX had a lower RMSE than NOtr-2, while NOtr-2 produced forecasts with a lower pinball score. 

--

- The .remember[choice of distribution assumed] for probabilistic forecasts and choice of .remember[model features] are as if not more important than the type of model employed; 

--

- The best performing models .remember[handled the non-negative and skewed nature] of the data automatically without the need for post-processing. 

---
## Conclusions

- Methods based on continuous-valued distributions are not adversely affected by the fact that the data are integer-valued. .remember[Rounding up predictive quantiles] to the next integer does not make predictions worse

--

- Out-of-the-box models, which require minimal tuning or manual development, do not perform as well as well-considered statistical approaches

--

- Of the models requiring a modest amount of user input and expertise, exponential smoothing (ETS) was found to perform well. However, its probabilistic forecasts were considerably worse than  NOtr-2 in terms of pinball score

--

- These observations reflect the characteristics of the data, which is representative of ED arrivals

---
## Future works


- More research is needed in the forecasting of other important variables such as .remember[length of stay, bed occupancy and waiting time], in addition to patient arrivals and admissions. This may require considering the dynamics among various services, including General Practitioners, Emergency Departments, Ambulance and Fire & Rescue services.
