## Why forecasting?

.pull-left[

- You do not forecast for the .remember[sake of forecasting]. 

- You do it because you want to base .remember[decisions] on it.

- Ideally, make .remember[better decisions] in the .remember[light of forecast].

.pull-right[

- The theory combines the concept of .remember[**social foundation**] with that of the .remember[**ecological ceiling**] in a single framework.

- .remember[**Social foundation:**] to ensure that no one falls short on life’s essentials.

- .remember[**Ecological ceiling:**] ensure we do not overshoot the planet’s capacity for critical life-supporting systems.

## Where do we want to be?

Between the .remember[social foundation] and the .remember[ecological ceiling] lies a space in which it is possible to .remember[meet the needs of all people] within the .remember[means of the living planet] — **an ecologically safe and socially just space in which humanity can .remember[THRIVE]**.

## Inform decisions that brings us into the space

- The forecasting and the decision-making process needs to support all activities that bring us into the Doughnut space — an environmentally safe and socially just space — in which humanity thrives.
