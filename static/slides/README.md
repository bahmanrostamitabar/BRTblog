Slides and resources for multiple seasonal forecasting seminar given to NHS in 2020.

#### Abstract

Improved data collection procedures has provides more potential for time series analysis and modelling. Many seasonal time series models have been designed with monthly and quarterly data in mind, where only a single seasonal pattern is evident. For time series, collecting data at higher frequencies (or possibly even measuring event times) reveals multiple seasonal patterns that require more flexible models to handle. This webinar will discuss the challenges that multiple seasonality presents, and introduce some strategies used to model and forecast these types of time series.
