## Forcasts can inform various planning horizons

Decision needs to be made to absorb demand uncertainty by providing effective and efficient staffing

- 6 months

- 42 days

- 48 hours

## Barriers in using forecasting


- Among other factors, .remember[disconnection] between forecasting and decision-making plays a role

- The vale/quality of a forecast should be determined by a decision it supports, something actionable

- Presenting both forecast accuracy and its impact can help to better use forecasting

---
## Aim of this project

- Evaluate the impact of forecasting on utility measure such as cost, overtime  staff, using emergency resources and waiting time

- Evaluate the use of probabilistic forecasting in planning

- What happens if you don't bother with forecasting methods

## Data

- Data is from an Accident and Emergency department in the UK 
- 5 years and 2 months of arrival time
- Public holidays, school holidays and rugby

## Forecasting methods

- Poisson Regression
    - Autoregressive lags, daily, weekly and yearly seasonality, Trend 
    
- Prophet
    -  daily, weekly and yearly seasonality, Trend
    
- ARIMA

- Exponential Smoothing 

- Seasonal Naive

- Evaluate the value for staffing (forecast for 42 days ahead)
