## Doing research before 2000


- Skim through card catalogues
- Read indexes, bibliographies, and citations manually to trace sources
- Writing codes in punch cards (1960s–1970s)
- Writing manual code in low-level languages like Assembly, Fortran, COBOL, or C (1980s–1990s)
- Compilation and execution were separate processes;

## How we do it now

- Software (Open source & free like R, Python)  (~2000-present)
- Graphical interfaces (Windows, macOS, GUIs for coding like VS Code, RStudio)
- Search engines (2000 - present)
- Online databases—knowing where to look such as Google Scholar, Scopus, JSTOR (~2000-present)

## The right Mindset for using AI tools

- Using AI tools for research and academic work is like the shift from physical libraries and manual coding to digital databases, and high-level ope-source coding with friendly interfaces—it requires us to .remember[build new intuitions],  approaching AI with the right mindset

- If we approach AI with the .remember[right mindset]—using it critically, verifying its outputs, and understanding its role—we can make it a powerful asset without compromising research integrity

## The right .remember[Mindset] for using AI tools

---
## Use AI as a tool, not a replacement for thinking, understanding and learning

.pull-left[
- Sometime the whole idea is to struggle, that may lead to something original
- Asking for a summary is not the same as reading for yourself
- Asking AI to solve a problem for you is not an effective way to learn
- AI should enhance, not replace, your intellectual effort
- Outsource academic labour to AI, but not critical thinking

## Use AI for the structure and framework, but keep the content yours

.remember[Structure]: the way information is arranged and presented
  - Outlines for journal articles, or grant proposals
  - Formatting and logical organisation
  - Sentence structure, clarity, and tone
  - Summarising or rephrasing
  - Converting structures (e.g., from text to table, etc)

.remember[Content] = The intellectual substance
- The original ideas, novel contribution,etc

---
## AI is a tool, not an authority! Don't over-rely on AI

.pull-left[
❌   Asking an AI something and simply accepting the answer, despite evidence pointing into a different direction.

- the errors are going to be very plausible
- plagiarism, data fabrication, and misrepresentation
- determine whether the AI is providing valuable outputs

✅ Always cross-check outputs with your expertise or external sources

## Use AI as an Assistant, Not a Researcher

.pull-left[
- Assist you in what you want to do, not to tell you what to do.
  - brainstorm
  - structure and refine questions
  - speed up literature review
  - reading and learning
  - coding and data analysis
  - editing, reformatting
  - Summarising

## Accountability lies with you, not AI

.pull-left[
- AI gives you outputs but you must .remember[take responsibility] for what you do with it
- You must adhere to .remember[research integrity] principles, including transparency in methodology 
- Citations and attribution remain your responsibility 
- You must ensure that your practice of using AI aligns with ethical standards,

## Adapt and experiment to build new intuitions over time

- Engage in active experimentation with AI tools
- Cross-check AI outputs
- Adapt your workflow as AI evolves
- By actively experimenting, verifying, and adapting AI into your workflow, you develop a natural intuition for using it—making AI an asset.
- **Always ask yourself**: .remember[How can AI enhance my research and learning workflow without replacing essential practices?]

| **Data Sources**                       | Massive text and code datasets, web data.                                                                                                                  | Primarily scientific literature (peer-reviewed papers, preprints, such as Semantic Scholar database, Open Alex, etc.).                              |
| **Output Format & Style**              | Conversational text, code, summaries. Often lacks formal citations.                                                                                        | Summaries, lists of key findings, and extracted data, often with citations and links to sources. Evidence-based.                                   |
| **Interaction Style**                  | Natural language prompts, open-ended questions.                                                                                                            | More structured queries, often focused on specific research questions.                                                                             |

| **Transparency & Explainability**      | Often a "black box." Difficult to understand how the tool arrived at a particular output.                                                                  | Aims for greater transparency by showing the source of information and the reasoning process.                                                      |

| **Multimodal Capabilities**            | Some models support images, code, and other formats alongside text. However, interpretation of scientific figures, tables, and equations is often limited. | Focused primarily on text-based research, but some tools can process and extract information from PDFs, graphs, and tables within academic papers. |
| **Customisability & Personalisation**  | Can be fine-tuned to some extent using custom instructions but lacks deep personalisation for research workflows.                                          | Often allows users to refine searches, track specific topics, and receive personalised research recommendations.                                   |

## Reading and learning 

$$CRPS(F, y) = \int \left( F(\hat{y}) - 1_{\{\hat{y} \geq y\}} \right)^2 d\hat{y}$$

Here is a formula in LaTeX: ...
The formula is about Continuous Ranked Probability score used to assess the performance of the forecast density.

Could you please break it down, and explain its components?

Could you derive the analytical expression for CRPS assuming the forecast follows a normal distribution?

could you provide a graphical representation of CDF versus the actual to better understand the concept?

## Dta analysis and coding in R & Python

>create an interactive tool in a  single page that visually shows me how correlation works, and why correlation alone is not a great descriptor of how the underlying data works in many cases. make it accessible to nonmath people and highly interactive and engaging.

.small[
- The interactive tool should also includes sections on correlation for non-linear data and simpson's paradox
- the interactive tools will also include two visualisations to demonstrate how correlation estimates vary with different sample sizes. You calculate correlation between two independent randon variable, and the you repeat for 10000 times for sample size 20 versus sample size 1000. then create visualisatiuons, X-axis shows the iteration number and y-xis the correlation.

### Use AI
✅ Work that contains some elements that you can understand but need help on the context or details.

✅ Work that research shows that AI is almost certainly helpful in - many kinds of coding, for example.

✅ Work where you need a first pass view 

✅ Work that is mere translation between frames or perspectives. 

✅ Work where you are an expert and can assess quickly whether AI is good or bad.

✅ Work that requires quantity like brainstorming.

## What AI skills should we learn and teach?

- Nobody knows what "AI skills" are as of today, let alone for the future. 

- We can learn a bit about how LLMs work, and give some advice on prompting, but, beyond that, what are we supposed to learn to make us "AI ready"?

- We may develop course to teach principles and develop the right mindset to use AI tools

## Discussion


1. How should AI be integrated into the research, teaching, and learning workflows at CARBS, and to what extent should its use be encouraged or regulated?

2. What strategies should CARBS adopt to equip faculty and students with the necessary skills and guidelines for AI use?

3. How can we ensure that AI tools complement, rather than replace, critical thinking, creativity, and human expertise in research and learning?
