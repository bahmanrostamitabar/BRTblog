---
## What makes a question a good Research Question?
### Very short answer

- a question that can be researched, and answered
  - he key idea is that evidence must exist (or be possible to collect) that could provide a believable answer.

- improve our understanding of how the world works
    - give us a reason for what we see in the world.
    Inform theory: A theory is just that—an explanation of why things are the way they are, whether big (like evolution) or small (like why bread prices rise).

---
## What makes a question a good Research Question?

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

- .remember[Forme] relates to the structure, wording, and clarity of the research question.

- .remember[Fond] pertains to the essence or substance of the question—its significance, relevance, and the intellectual weight it carries in contributing to knowledge or solving a problem.

---
## Forme

- Clear definition &amp; precision in wording

- Focused scope

- Researchable constructs

- Neutrality

- Relevance to audience

---
## Clear definition &amp; precision in wording
Explanation: Avoids vague, subjective, or undefined terms that could lead to multiple interpretations.

--

❌ How does AI improve healthcare?
("Improve" is too vague—what aspect of healthcare? For whom?)

--

✅  How does AI-assisted radiology affect diagnostic accuracy in lung cancer screening?"
(Uses specific terms like "AI-assisted radiology" and "diagnostic accuracy" within a defined context.)


---
## Focused scope
The research question should not be too broad or too narrow, ensuring it is researchable

--

❌ How does AI transform global healthcare?
(Too broad—"transform" is vague, and "global healthcare" covers too many contexts.)

--

✅ How do AI-powered virtual assistants affect patient engagement in chronic disease management? (Specific technology, targeted effect, and a clear healthcare focus.)


---
# Researchable constructs
The question should contain terms that can be measured, analyzed, or observed within a research design.

--

❌ How does AI revolutionize patient care?
("Revolutionize" is too abstract—how do you measure it?)

--

✅ What factors influence the accuracy, speed, and user satisfaction of AI-based triage systems in emergency care settings? (Clear measurable factors—"effectiveness" can be studied through accuracy, speed, or user satisfaction.)

---
## Neutrality

A research question should not assume an outcome or imply bias.

--

❌ Why is AI better than human doctors in diagnosing diseases?
(Loaded with bias—assumes AI is superior.)

--

✅ What are the strengths and limitations of AI-driven decision-making in healthcare diagnostics?
(Encourages an objective assessment of both positives and negatives.)

---
## Relevance to audience
The question should address a meaningful problem that is significant to its intended academic, professional, or societal audience.

--

❌ Do doctors like AI in hospitals?
(Too trivial—"like" is subjective, and the focus isn’t meaningful for decision-making.)

--

✅ How do AI-driven predictive models impact treatment plans in oncology?
(Addresses a key issue in cancer treatment—highly relevant to medical professionals and researchers.)

## What to cite? Audience and prior research

- Your research question is part of a much bigger puzzle
- Identifying the audience talking about the puzzle
- Reviewing prior research around the puzzle
- Positioning your new research
  - the novel aspects of your research, such as a new perspective, a different foundation, an overlooked set of arguments, or new data and methods

❌ Data and analysis colour coded 

❌ Click and point analysis

❌ Copy and paste graphs , results, and tables

❌ Tables typed by hand
]

.pull-right[
✅ All data edits scripted

✅ All analysis scripted

✅ Graphs and tables automatically pulled in to the thesis or papers

✅ Tables generated with scripts or read from csv/xls files
]

---
## Reproducibility

Someone (or your future self) should be able to reproduce your work without having to guess what software you had installed, what versions, which files do what, etc.

- Stay organized.
- One system for doing this using R or python or both is to write your work in an Rmarkdown or Quarto file.
- Track software versions

---
## Version control

- thesis_v1, thesis_v2, etc., is not adequate version control.
- You need to track changes over time, have a remote repository, and be able to roll back as required.
- Your repository should contain everything required to produce your thesis including computer code, references, writing.
- Your repository should have an obvious structure and be fully documented.
- .remember[Github] solves these problems
- Read “Happy git with R”: happygitwithr.com

---
## Version control with git

- Git and github can be used with any text-based language including Python, LaTeX, R, Rmarkdown, Quarto,
markdown, etc.

- Git allows you to:
  - track changes
  - experiment in branches
  - undo

- Github provides:
  - backup and restore
  - synchronization

---
## Transparency &amp; ethics

- Always conduct research and present findings .remember[truthfully], without fabrication, falsification, or selective reporting.
- Be transparent about your research methodologies, including the tools, techniques, and processes you use, .remember[Embrace reproducibility]
- Be accountable for your research and ensure that others can reproduce your results.
- Ensure that research involving human subjects, or sensitive data is conducted ethically, with respect for privacy and rights.
- Give proper acknowledgment and credit to all contributors, collaborators, and prior research.

## Writing 
### Microsoft word

❌ Impossible to do proper version control

❌ Poor formatting of equations

❌ Impossible to make reproducible

❌ More difficult to automate cross-referencing, numbering

❌ Files more likely to be corrupted

❌ With One Drive , even worse

---
## Writing 
### Quarto

✅  Combines R, Python , plain text and LaTeX into one system, reference management

✅  One tool to do all , writing, analysis, version control, file sharing, etc

✅  Render files to pdf, word, html, and latex formats

✅  Reproducible research

✅  See quarto.org for help

---
## Writing 
### Overleaf

- Real-time collaboration

- Simplified LaTeX editing

- Wide range of templates

- Automatic version control
