## Base forecast

- Producing independent forecasts, also refereed to as base forecasts, typically by different teams as the need for such forecasts arise.

- Same or different forecasting model could be used in each level.

- Forecasts are not coherent, the would not add up as time series does.

## Reconciled forecasts

- This approach involves first generating independently  base forecast for each series in the hierarchy (they will not add up according to the hierarchical structure). 
- Reconciliation is a post-forecasting process aimed at improving the accuracy of the base forecasts (however obtained) 
- The Reconciliation approach combines the base forecasts and generates a set of revised forecasts that aggregate consistently with the hierarchical structure (they are coherent).

## Time series of ambulance demand

**An inherent hierarchical and grouped structure**

- Historical daily demand for over 5 years
- Demand for ambulance services at the country level can be disaggregated into:

    - a geographical hierarchy into control, health boards
    - groups (attributes) such as the nature of incidents and priority.

---
## Forecasting setup

- Forecasting to inform a planning horizon of 42 days
- The forecast horizon is 84 days ahead
- Point and probabilistic forecasts are generated and evaluated for the entire hierarchy
- Forecasts are evaluated using time series cross validation tested on the last year of data

.center[
<img src="figure/wast_hiararchy/planning_horizon.png" height="400px">
]

---
## Forecasting models

- **Naive:** Assuming that the future days will be similar to past days. We use the empirical distribution of the past daily demand
- **Exponential Smoothing State Space model (ETS):** ETS models can combine trend, seasonality, and error components in a time series
- **Generalized Linear Model (GLM):** GLMs are a family of models developed to extend the concept of linear regression models to non-Gaussian distributions 
- **Poisson Regression using tscount (TSGLM):** We also consider another Poisson regression model that takes into account serial dependence
- **Ensemble method:** Finally, we use an ensemble method that combines the forecasts generated from the Naive, ETS, GLM and TSGLM models to form a mixture distribution

## What if hierarchies are ignored

❌  Forecasts are not consistent  no  coherency.

❌  Base forecasts can result in lack of consistency and coordination, leading to less effective planning and decision making. 

❌  Teams operating in isolation leading to conflicts, duplication work, rework, or work that runs counter to the overall goal to improve the quality of delivery service.

❌ Not using all information available at the other levels of hierarchy to improve your forecast.

---
## Benefit of hierarchical/grouped time series forecasting

✅  Plans at any level are based on .remember[coherent forecasts] and therefore can be aligned. 

✅  Hierarchical forecasting framework can be used as a tool to .remember[improve coordination] between teams across the care services at the national, sub-national, regional and local levels.

✅  Result in .remember[more accurate than the independent (base) forecasts].

✅  Hierarchical forecasting can be used to create coherent forecast, regardless of how base forecasts are created, even with judgmental forecasts.

---
## Temporal and cross-temporal hierarchies

- Here we discussed hierarchical and grouped time series, which deals with these structure at a one time granularity.

- The same issues arise when you need to forecast across different temporal granularities. You have an hourly time series, you want to forecast future daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly demand

- It is also possible to combine hierarchical and temporal hierarchies together

---
## Potential topics for research

- High dimensional hierarchical forecasting
- Forecasting with high frequency data
- Probabilistic hierarchical forecasting for discrete distributions
- Machine learning and AI approaches to hierarchical forecasting
- Hierarchical forecasting with explanatory variables
- Applications of hierarchical forecasting to other services in healthcare

## Reconciled forecasts-notations

- Let $\large {b}_t$ be a vector of $\large n_b$ _bottom-level_ time series at time $\large t$, and let $\large {a}_t$ be a corresponding vector of $\large n_a = n-n_b$ aggregated time series, where $\large a_t = {A}{b}_t,$

--

- $\large A$ is the $\large n_a\times n_b$ "aggregation" matrix specifying how the bottom-level series ${b}_t$ are to be aggregated to form $\large {a}_t$. 

--

- The full vector of time series is given by $\large y_t = \begin{bmatrix}{a}_t \\{b}_t\end{bmatrix}.$

--

- This leads to the $\large n\times n_b$ "summing" or "structural" matrix given by
$\large S = \begin{bmatrix}{A} \\ {I}_{n_b}\end{bmatrix}$, such that $\large {y}_t = {S}{b}_t$.

##  Linear reconciliation methods, Bottom-up and others

Forecast reconciliation approaches combine and reconcile all the base forecasts in order to produce coherent forecasts. 

--

Linear reconciliation methods (Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos, and Hyndman 2019) can be written as

$$\large \tilde{{y}}_h = {S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h ={S}{G}\hat{{y}}_h = {M}\hat{{y}}_h,$$

where ${W}$ is an $n \times n$ positive definite matrix, and $\hat{{y}}_h$ contains the $h$-step forecasts of ${y}_{T+h}$ given data to time $T$. 

--

.small[
- Different choices for ${W}$ lead to different solutions such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Minimum Trace (MinT). 
- We use the implementation of these methods in the `hts` package in R in the experiment.

## Producing probabilistic forecasts

- We use bootstrapping to generate probabilistic forecasts:

    - Suppose that $(\hat{{y}}_h^{[1]},\dots,\hat{{y}}_h^{[B]})$ are a set of $B$ simulated sample paths, generated independently from the models used to produce the base forecasts. 
    - Then $({S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h^{[1]},\dots,{S}({S}'{W}^{-1}{S})^{-1}{W}^{-1}\hat{{y}}_h^{[B]})$ provides a set of reconciled sample paths, from which percentiles can be calculated.
