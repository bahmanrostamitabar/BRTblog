I am Professor of Analytics & Decision Sciences at Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University in the United Kingdom. I am the founder and the Director of the [Data Lab for Social Good Research Group](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/data-lab-for-social-good) at Cardiff University and also the founder of the [Forecasting for Social Good committee](https://www.f4sg.org/) at the International Institute of Forecasters. My research focus lies in leveraging analytics to provide informed insights from data for planning & decision-making processes in sectors contributing to social good, such as healthcare operations, and global health and humanitarian logistics \& supply chains. <br>
I have recieved the Goodeve Medal in 2024 from [the Operational Research Society](https://www.theorsociety.com/) for outstanding contributions to Operational Research.
