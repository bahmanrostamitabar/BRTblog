My life objective is to help the world becoming a better place by offering my skills and passion for research and education. To that end, I have created two initiatives that put the society/people in the heart of my research, teaching and engagement activities: 1) [Democratising Forecasting](https://www.bahmanrt.com/#dforecasting) (DF); 2) [Forecasting for Social Good](https://www.bahmanrt.com/#fsgood) (FSG).
