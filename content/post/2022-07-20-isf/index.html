<p>Last week I attended the <a href="https://isf.forecasters.org/">42<sup>nd</sup> International Symposium of Forecasting</a> at the University of Oxford. This was my first in-person conference since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. I met many colleagues and friends and listened to many inspiring talks.</p>
<p>I presented two papers myself and co-authored four others presented by my colleagues and Ph.D.Â students.</p>
