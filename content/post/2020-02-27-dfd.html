<h2>Import data</h2>
<p>You can first create a subdirectory called <code>data</code> located in your project directory and then download url_dataset=“/data/ae.csv” and save it into <code>data</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p>The first step in any forecasting project using R is to import data into R. Our data is stored in the project directory, in a sub directory called <em>data</em>. The format of data is <code>.csv</code>, so we need to find a function that imports <code>.csv</code> files into R. If you don’t know which fucntion to use, just <em>google</em> it and find an apparopriate function for your data.</p>
<p>We do almost everything in R using functions, a function is a name that is immediately followed by <code>()</code>, e.g. <code>read_csv()</code>. We need to remeber the name of functions, what they can get as inputs, how they can process inputs and what they give us as outputs. we call inputs <code>arguments</code> and outputs <code>value</code>. Use help file to see details of <code>read_csv()</code>. Type <code>?read_csv</code> in the Console.</p>
<p>We use <code>read_csv()</code> function from <code>readr</code> package which is a part of <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse package</a>.
If you have not already installed tidyverse package, you need to install it now. Installing a package means bringing it from its server to your computer. Once installed, you need to make it available to your project using <code>library()</code> function whenver you open your project, we say load the package.
To install the package, go to Tools -&gt; Install Packages and type tidyverse in the box, finally click on <code>Install</code> button to install it.</p>
<p>The first argument to read_csv() is the path to the <code>ae.csv</code> file. you can use an absolute path because you created a project at the beginning and save your data into <code>data</code> subdirectory.
There are many other arguments for each fucntion</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ae &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;data/ae.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   age = col_double(),
##   gender = col_character(),
##   injury_type = col_character(),
##   arrival_time = col_character()
## )</code></pre>
<p>It is always useful to check the structure of your data using <code>class()</code>. Becasue different fuctions may accept different data structure. It will tell you what is the structure. In our case it is a tibble, a kind of data frame. To know more about data structure see <a href="">here</a></p>
<p>You can also check the data type of each variable.</p>

<h2>Ensure your data is tidy</h2>
<p>Many organisations work with spredsheets that are not in a tidy format. But what is a tidy format? we don’t mean cleaning data here. <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">Tidy data</a> is defined in as:</p>
<p>Any dataset that satisfies the followign criteria is tidy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each variable must have its own column.</li>
<li>Each observation must have its own row.</li>
<li>Each value must have its own cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, a dataset is tidy if it is in the form of a table(tibble, dataframe) where each column is a seperate variable.</p>
<p>If data is not in tidy format, we need to make it tidy using functions available in the <code>tidyr</code> package of tidyverse.</p>
<p>See this presentation for more information about <a href="https://www.londonr.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/Get-good-data-out-of-bad-spreadsheets-with-tidy-tools.pdf">messy spredsheets</a></p>
