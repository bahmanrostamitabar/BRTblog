<p>I am looking for a new PhD student on “Forecasting improvements for better reproductive health and family planning operations in global health supply chains”</p>
<div id="project-context" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Context</h2>
<p>Hundreds-of-millions of women in developing countries lack access to contraceptives. Sound inventory/replenishment decisions of contraceptives rely upon accurate demand forecasts; poor forecasts lead to either: (i) poor availability, which results to dropouts and unwanted pregnancies, with serious societal consequences such as poverty; or occasionally (ii) excessive stocks that are not being used and are wasted! Producing good/effective forecasts is very challenging though because of: (i) lack of data availability and data quality issues ; (ii) complex demand and lead-time patterns; (iii) forecasting needs at multiple levels of geographical hierarchies; and (iv) lack of an integrated inventory-forecasting framework. The as-is inventory-forecasting process in developing counties is highly problematic since it cannot address these challenges, resulting in poor decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-aims" class="section level2">
<h2>Project aims</h2>
<p>This project aims at making a scientific contribution by: (i) creating an innovative forecasting/machine learning approach to accurately forecast demand of contraceptive products (including new products) in the presence of low-quality data; (ii) do so by feature engineering to select variables with high causal power rather than relying on historical consumption only; (iii) strengthen the method by introducing hierarchical &amp; grouping structure of the problem; and (iv) link forecasting to inventory optimisation through the accurate determination of the underlying loss function accounting for both monetary and non-monetary factors. These are suggested aims and there is scope for student to further develop and refine research aims and produce research questions.</p>

<li>Machine learning / deep learning</li>
<li>Supply Chain Management</li>
<li>Global Health</li>
<li>Humanitarian Operations</li>
<li>R (and Python) programming experience</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t expect that you have studied some topics such as time series analysis, forecasting, machine learning. If you have a solid background in statistics and mathematics, then you’ll pick up the necessary material as required.</p>
