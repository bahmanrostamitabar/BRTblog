<p>This four-hour workshop will provide a gentle introduction to machine learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called <a href="https://github.com/tidymodels">tidymodels</a>. We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, weâ€™ll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, the holdout method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip">parsnip</a>, <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample">rsample</a>, <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/">recipes</a>, <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/">yardstick</a>, <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/">tune</a>, and <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/workflows/">workflows</a>.</p>
