summary: "The paper deals with the problem of temporal aggregation in time series
  forecasting. The question is, is it better to use aggregate data? For example, is
  it better to use weekly figures rather than daily?  Temporal aggregation is an intuitively
  appealing approach to deal with demand uncertainty. In this article, the authors
  examine the effectiveness of temporal aggregation for forecasting finite auto-correlated
  demand. They also conduct an empirical evaluation to validate the analytical results
  using monthly time series of the M4-competition dataset. The degree of autocorrelation,
  the forecast horizon and the length of the series are all found to be important
  determinants of forecast accuracy. The paper discusses the merits of each approach
  and highlights their implications for real-world practices."
