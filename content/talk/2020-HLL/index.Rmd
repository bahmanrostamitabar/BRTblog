summary: A gap is found between the modelling process and its implementation by decision-makers in the healthcare sector.
A structured literature review helps build two frameworks with key factors, one for enablers and another for barriers of model implementations.
Using empirical data, these frameworks are cross-validated to improve and motivate the use of OR models in healthcare.
