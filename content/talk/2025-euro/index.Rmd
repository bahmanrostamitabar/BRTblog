summary: "Data-driven organizations around the world routinely use forecasting methods
  to improve their planning and decision-making capabilities. Although much research
  exists on the harms resulting from traditional machine learning applications, little
  has specifically focused on the ethical impact of time series forecasting. Yet forecasting
  raises unique ethical issues due to the way it is used in different organizational
  contexts, supports different goals, and involves different data processing, model
  development, and evaluation pipelines. These differences make it difficult to apply
  machine learning harm taxonomies to common forecasting contexts. We leverage multiple
  interviews with expert industry practitioners and academic researchers to remedy
  this knowledge gap by cataloguing and analysing under-explored domains, applications,
  and scenarios where forecasting may cause harm, with the goal of developing a novel
  taxonomy of forecasting-specific harms. Inspired by the Microsoft Azure taxonomy
  for responsible innovation, we combined a human-led inductive coding scheme with
  an AI-driven analysis centered on the extraction of key taxonomies of harm in forecasting.
  The taxonomy is designed to guide researchers and practitioners and encourage ethical
  reflection on the impact of their decisions during the forecasting process. A secondary
  objective is to create a research agenda focused on possible forecasting-related
  measures to mitigate harm. Our work extends the growing literature on machine learning
  harms by identifying unique forms of harm that may occur in forecasting"
