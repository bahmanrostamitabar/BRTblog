Using a temporal dataset from healthcare, weâ€™ll learn about the forecasting process, theroy behind forecasting models and use R to apply them in the data set.

This is a free workshop to support the learning and application of forecasting using R in the NHS across the U.K. in collaboration with [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/about/). The workshop is initially designed for 2 days, 09:00- 16:30.

We are offering five workshops in 2020.
