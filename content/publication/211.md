abstract = "Forecasting plays a critical role in the development of organisational business strategies. Despite a considerable body of research in the area of forecasting,  the focus has largely
been on the financial and economic outcomes of the forecasting process as opposed to societal benefits. Our motivation in this study is to promote the latter, with a view to using
the forecasting process to advance social and environmental objectives such as equality,
social justice and sustainability. We refer to such forecasting practices as Forecasting for
Social Good (FSG) where the benefits to society and the environment take precedence
over economic and financial outcomes. We conceptualise FSG and discuss its scope and
boundaries in the context of the `Doughnut theory`. We present some key attributes that
qualify a forecasting process as FSG: it is concerned with a real problem; it is focused on
advancing social and environmental goals and prioritises these over conventional measures of economic success; and it has a broad societal impact. We also position FSG in the
wider literature on forecasting and social good practices. We propose an FSG maturity
framework as the means to engage academics and practitioners with research in this area.
Finally, we highlight that FSG: (i) cannot be distilled to a prescriptive set of guidelines,
(ii) is scalable, and (iii) has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing
social objectives."
