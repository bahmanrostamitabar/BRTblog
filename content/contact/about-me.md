After high school, I moved to Tehran and studied Industrial Engineering, receiving my BSc. from [K.N.Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/) (2004). Following my graduation, I have worked in various companies in different industries as planning engineer in Tehran and South of Iran. 
I then decided to continue my studies and recieved my MSc in Industrial Engineering from [Tarabiat Modares University](https://www.modares.ac.ir/en)(2008). After working in the project managemt filed for two years, I decided to pursue my PhD in France. I moved to France in 2009 and recieved my PhD from the [University of Bordeuax](https://www.u-bordeaux.com/), France in 2014.
Following that, I have spent two years at [Ecole Central-Supelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) for my post doctoral reserach.

I am now a Professor in Data-Driven Decision Science at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/598316-rostami-tabar-bahman).

I am very passionate about forecasting, analytics, modeling and knowledge sharing. I have created [Forecasting for Social Good](https://www.f4sg.org/) initiative sponsored by the [International Institute of forecasters](https://forecasters.org/events/iif-workshops/).

I am the founder and the [Director of the Data Lab for Social Good Research Group](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/explore/research-units/data-lab-for-social-good) at Cardiff University. 

I specialise in the development and application of forecasting and management science tools and techniques. My focus lies in leveraging these methodologies to provide informed insights for planning & decision-making in sectors contributing to social good, including healthcare operations, global health and humanitarian supply chains, social sustainability, and governmental policy
