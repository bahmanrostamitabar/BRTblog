One of the key objectives of my research is to use Operational Research techniques to improve decision making in organizations with social missions, thereby positively contributing to advancing knowledge in the field of forecasting practice for social good.

Forecasting for Social Good incorporates the need of society rather than emphasising a pure financial performance with two main elements: i) decisions are not directly driven by profit and ii) gives priority to those who are generally external to the organisation. Topic may include but not limited to: 

* Health
* Humanitarian and disaster relief
* Education
* Goverments
* Social services

Forecasting for Social Good Initiative aims to explore and expose how (where) forecasting can have positive societal impact. The objective is threefold: i) expose the importance of forecasting for social good, ii) capture the otherwise dispersed current state of knowledge, and set the agenda to drive developments iii) create and establish research collaboration and partnership at the national and international level.

To that end, I have organised the first international workshop dedicated to the use of forecasting for social good in Cardiff University on Thursday and Friday 12-13 July 2018. This workshop was  an important step to bring more attention to this extremely important topic. It brings together researchers and practitioners across 10 countries to discuss research agenda in this area, whilst helping me broaden my network and introduce important research collaborations with academics as well as build solid partnerships with organizations.
