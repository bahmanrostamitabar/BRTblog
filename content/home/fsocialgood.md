One of the key objectives of my research is to use Operational Research techniques to improve decision making in organizations with social missions, thereby positively contributing to advancing knowledge in the field of forecasting practice for social good. My goal is to influence relevant practices in academia and organisations. 

To that end, I have organised the first international workshop dedicated to the use of forecasting for social good in Cardiff University on Thursday and Friday 12-13 July 2018. Please see [24th IIF workshop on Forecasting for Social Good](https://spark.adobe.com/page/hLOW4JNxQ4TIA/) for more information.


This workshop was  an important step to bring more attention to this extremely important topic. It brings together researchers and practitioners across 10 countries to discuss research agenda in this area, whilst helping me broaden my network and introduce important research collaborations with academics as well as build solid partnerships with organizations. 


A new website dedicated to "forecasting for Social Good" is under constraction:
