This is an ongoing initiative, sponsored by the [International Institute of Forecasters](https://forecasters.org/) will provide cutting-edge training in the use of forecasting with R in some of the world's least developed countries to transfer knowledge in forecasting and help decision makers use it as an effective tool to support decision-making process. R is an open source programming language and software widely used for data analysis, manipulation, visualisation and modelling.

"These workshops aim to provide up-to-date training on the principles of forecasting and create an international network to conduct research on forecasting with social impact for less developed countries."

The workshops will be provided by Dr Bahman Rostami-Tabar whose research focuses on forecasting for social good, supply chain forecasting and the interface between forecasting and decision-making. For more information please see [IIF Website](https://forecasters.org/blog/2018/07/10/new-iif-workshop-initiative-democratizing-forecasting/)
