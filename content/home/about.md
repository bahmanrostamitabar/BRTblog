# About me

My life objective is to help the world becoming a better place by freely offering his skills and developing free resources.

In this blog, I am writing about forecasting for social good and democratising forecasting.

1. [**Forecasting for Social Good**](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1123152-forecasting-for-social-good-in-india) investigates various applications of forecasting with social impact- such as health, humanitarian, disaster relief, public governance, education, enviroment and social services- regardless of the financial implications, or optimisations attempted based on economic terms. 

2. [**Democratising Forecasting**](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1043333-democratising-forecasting) aims to make forecasting and data analytics accessible to a wider public through delivering a series of workshops in some of the world's developing to least developed countries to train people and help organizations use it as an effective tool to support decision making.
