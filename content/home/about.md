My life objective is to help the world becoming a better place by freely offering my skills and developing free resources. To that end, I have established two main initiatives that put the society/people in the heart of my research, teaching and engagement activities: 1) Democratising Forecasting; 2) Forecasting for Social Good.

My research goals are directed toward the use of Operations Research (OR) techniques to improve decision making in supply chains and operations management, and as such positively contribute to both industrial and societal advancements.
